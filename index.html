<p>This is my multi-month study plan for going from web developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to Google software engineer. Please don't let that offend you if you are a web developer. I'm just speaking from my knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>It's a long list, extracted and expanded from Google's coaching notes, so these are the things you need to know. There are extra items I added at the end that may come up in the interview or be helpful in solving a problem.</p>

<p>Many items are from Steve Yegge's "<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html">Get that job at Google</a>" and are reflected sometimes word-for-word in Google's coaching notes.</p>

<a id="why-use-it" class="anchor" href="#why-use-it" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why use it?</h3>

<p>I'm following this plan to prepare for my Google interview. I've been building the web, building
services, and launching startups since 1997. I have an economics degree, not a CS degree.  I've
been very successful in my career, but I want to work at Google. I want to progress into larger systems
and get a real understanding of computer systems, algorithmic efficiency, data structure performance,
low-level languages, and how it all works. And if you don't know any of it, Google won't hire you.</p>

<p>When I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to
traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good.
Every data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked
under the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory, unless a process I was running would give an "out of
memory" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multi-dimensional arrays in my life and
thousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.</p>

<p>But after going through this study plan I have high confidence I'll be hired. It's a long plan. It's going to take me
months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.</p>
