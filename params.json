  "body": "### What is it?\r\n\r\nThis is my multi-month study plan for going from web developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to Google software engineer. Please don't let that offend you if you are a web developer. I'm just speaking from my knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nIt's a long list, extracted and expanded from Google's coaching notes, so these are the things you need to know. There are extra items I added at the end that may come up in the interview or be helpful in solving a problem.\r\n\r\nMany items are from Steve Yegge's \"[Get that job at Google](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html)\" and are reflected sometimes word-for-word in Google's coaching notes.\r\n\r\n## [Start Learning &raquo;](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Why use it?\r\n\r\nI'm following this plan to prepare for my Google interview. I've been building the web, building\r\nservices, and launching startups since 1997. I have an economics degree, not a CS degree.  I've\r\nbeen very successful in my career, but I want to work at Google. I want to progress into larger systems\r\nand get a real understanding of computer systems, algorithmic efficiency, data structure performance,\r\nlow-level languages, and how it all works. And if you don't know any of it, Google won't hire you.\r\n\r\nWhen I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to\r\ntraverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good.\r\nEvery data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked\r\nunder the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory, unless a process I was running would give an \"out of\r\nmemory\" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multi-dimensional arrays in my life and\r\nthousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.\r\n\r\nBut after going through this study plan I have high confidence I'll be hired. It's a long plan. It's going to take me\r\nmonths. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.\r\n\r\n### Get in a Googley Mood\r\n\r\nPrint out a \"[future Googler](https://github.com/jwasham/project-9894/blob/master/future-googler.pdf)\" sign (or two) and keep your eyes on the prize.\r\n\r\n### Follow me\r\n\r\n![John Washam - Google Interview University](https://dng5l3qzreal6.cloudfront.net/2016/Jul/me_circle-1467757502022.jpg)\r\n\r\nI'm on the journey.
